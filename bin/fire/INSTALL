This document tries to give a short overview on how to make a running
demo system using fire and a small database.

You need several things.
 - the FIRE archive (that you probably have, as you obviously can read
   this text)
 - an apache web server (maybe you already have one, anyway here in
   this document it is described how to compile your own one.)
 - to be able to use ALL features of fire you will need several libs. 
   Some of them are publicly available, but not all:
   
   * KD-Tree library by Javi Cano: 
     This library is released under GPL, but as far as I know there is
     no public download site. You need it for
     globallocalfeaturedistance, which is not one of the most
     important features. Thus you can probably live without it. Anyway
     if you want to use it, feel free to contact either me, or Javi
     himself (http://www.iti.upv.es/~jcano/). I am pretty sure that he
     will give it to you, don't forget to greet him from me :-)
     But I propose to start without it. To do so, remove all lines
     starting with KDTREE from the Makefile.


   * interpolation library by Philipe Thevenaz
     http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/interpolation/

     mkdir interpol
     cd interpol
     wget http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/interpolation/interpol.tar
     tar -xf interpol.tar
     mv interpol/* .
     
     this library is needed for interpolation of images, some routines
     in imagelib need them and the invariant feature extraction tools
     need them. You probably want to use it.

  * libfft
    is available for most linux distributions.
    This is necessary for Gabor features. As currently gabor features
    are not yet very much tested, you probably won't need it.

    Here I suggest to start without it, too. To do so, remove all
    lines starting with FFT_ from the Makefile


INSTALLING APACHE
  go to the apache website and get the latest version of their HTTP server
  currently this is 2.0.53.
  In the following I assume that you want to install FIRE in the
  directory $FIREDST

  mkdir $FIREDST
  cd $FIREDST
  mkdir apache
  tar -xzf (YOURDOWNLOADDIR)/httpd-2.0.53.tar.gz
  cd httpd-2.0.53
  ./configure --prefix $FIREDST/apache
  make 
  make install



INSTALLING FIRE
  mkdir $FIREDST/fire
  cd $FIREDST/fire
  tar -xvzf (YOURDOWNLOADDIR)/fire-v2.0.1.tar.gz

  then get the libraries (kdtree?, interpol?, fft?) you need and put
  them to places consistent with those you configure in the Makefile

  Once you have done so, you can enter

  make fire 
 
  which compiles the fire binary only or

  make all

  which will compile the fire binary and all feature extraction tools.

  This should run rather smoothly although some people report that
  they have to tweak the code slightly if they are using a different
  flavor of unix than linux. 


SETTING UP THE WEBINTERFACE:
  Copy fire.py from the cgi directory in the fire sources to fire.cgi
  to the cgi-bin directory of your apache installation.

  Copy deuteriumconfig.py from the cgi directory in the fire sources to config.py
  in cgi-bin directory of your apache installation and change the
  pathes to the appropriate places. if your webserver and your fire
  server are the same computer (as I assume) change
  fireServer="deuterium" to fireServer="localhost". This one is the
  most crucial setting, all the others should not influence the
  functionality of fire.

  Copy img.py from the cgi directory in the fire sources to the
  cgi-bin directory of your apache server

  Furthermore you should copy the imagefiles postive.png,
  negative.png, neutral.png to places that can be accessed via the the
  web and change config.py accordingly.

  After this you should be able to access your fire webinterface and
  it should say something like "fire server not available" as you have
  not yet started one.
 

SETTING UP A DATABASE:
  To setup a database for FIRE you need several things:

  let's say you have a directory database were you have some images
  (something between 100 and 1000 should be enough for a start).

  Then you have to extract features from these images. To make it easy I
  will explain this for color histograms.

  go to the directory where you have your images (assuming all images
  are jpg, although fire can read lots of different formats as it uses
  the routines from imagemagick) and call

  extractcolorhistogram --color --images *.jpg

  this then extracts color histograms for all your images.

  then you make a filelist which you can load using fire. this has to be
  of the following form:

  ------
  FIRE_filelist
  path <pathtoyourimages>
  suffix color.histo.gz
  file image1.jpg
  file image2.jpg
  file
  ...
  ..
  ..
  -----

  When you have done this, you can use fire to read this database:

  fire -f <pathtoyourfilelist> -d 0 jsd -r 10

  to start a fire loading this filelist, set distance 0 to jsd (which
  automatically sets the weight for distance 0 to 1.0, and to make fire
  return
  the 10 best matches for every query.

  Having done so, you should be able to contact fire e.g. by the
  webinterface
  or for easier testing you can use telnet.

  ---
  # telnet localhost 12960   # to connect to fire

  and you can use e.g. the command "info" to get some information about
  the state of fire or use help to get a list of all available commands.

  With "bye" you can disconnect from fire, with quit you can end the
  server.
